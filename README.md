# 🤖 Gemini Client Console

A powerful, interactive command-line client for Google's Gemini AI API featuring **Hyper-Contextual Grounding**, **multi-turn conversations**, **real-time streaming**, and XDG-compliant logging.

## 🔑 Quick Start - API Key Required!

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: You need a Google Gemini API key to use this application!**

### Getting Your API Key

1. **Get a FREE API key** from Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Click "Get API Key" and follow the instructions.
3. Copy your API key (starts with `AIza...`).

### Setting Your API Key

The application supports multiple configuration methods (in priority order):

1. **User Secrets** (Recommended for development):
   ```bash
   dotnet user-secrets set "GeminiSettings:ApiKey" "YOUR_API_KEY"

```

2. **Environment Variables**:
```bash
export GeminiSettings__ApiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"

```


3. **appsettings.json** in the executable directory:
```json
{
  "GeminiSettings": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
    "BaseUrl": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/",
    "DefaultModel": "gemini-2.5-flash"
  }
}

```

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Hyper-Contextual Environmental Grounding (New!)

The client completely eliminates "temporal hallucinations" by injecting real-time system data into every request.

* **Zero Hallucinations**: The model knows the exact local date, time, and timezone.
* **OS Awareness**: It knows it is running on Linux (Fedora), Windows, or macOS and adapts its answers (e.g., providing Bash vs. PowerShell commands).
* **Locale Context**: Responses are formatted according to your system's region settings.

### 💬 Multi-Turn Conversations

Engage in stateful, context-aware conversations. The client remembers your previous exchanges within a session, allowing for natural follow-up questions. Use the `reset` command to start fresh.

### 🌊 Real-time Streaming

* **SSE Support**: True real-time communication with the Gemini API using Server-Sent Events.
* **Performance Optimizations**: Configured with Server GC and Concurrent GC for high-throughput response handling.
* **Live Metrics**: Monitor token speed (tokens/s) and first-response latency in real-time.

### 🤖 Dynamic Model Selection

* **Live Discovery**: Fetches available models directly from the Gemini API at startup.
* **Smart Fallbacks**: Gracefully handles API errors with a curated fallback list.

### 📝 Conversation Logging

All prompts, responses, and session statistics are automatically logged to text files.

* **Linux**: `~/.local/share/gemini-client/logs/` (XDG compliant)
* **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/GeminiClient/logs/`
* **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GeminiClient\logs\`

## 💻 Usage

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `exit` | Quit the application and display session stats |
| `reset` | Clear conversation context and start fresh |
| `model` | Change the selected AI model |
| `stats` | View detailed session statistics |
| `log` | Open the log folder in your file manager |
| `stream` | Toggle streaming mode ON/OFF |
