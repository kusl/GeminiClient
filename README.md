# 🤖 Gemini Client Console

A powerful, interactive command-line client for Google's Gemini AI API with **real-time streaming**, model selection, performance metrics, and session statistics.

## 🔑 Quick Start - API Key Required!

> 
> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: You need a Google Gemini API key to use this application!** 
> 
> 

### Getting Your API Key

1. **Get a FREE API key** from Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Click "Get API Key" and follow the instructions.
3. Copy your API key (starts with `AIza...`).

### Setting Your API Key

The application supports multiple configuration methods in the following priority:

1. **User Secrets** (Recommended for development): `dotnet user-secrets set "GeminiSettings:ApiKey" "YOUR_API_KEY"` 


2. **Environment Variables**: `export GeminiSettings__ApiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"` 


3. **appsettings.json**: Create this file in the executable directory:



```json
{
  "GeminiSettings": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
    "StreamingEnabled": true
  }
}

```

## 🚀 Features

### 🌊 Real-time Streaming (v0.0.7 Optimized)

* **SSE Support**: True real-time communication with the Gemini API using Server-Sent Events.


* **Performance Optimizations**: Configured with Server GC and Concurrent GC for high-throughput real-time response handling.


* **Live Metrics**: Monitor token speed (tokens/s) and first-response latency in real-time.



### Interactive Model Selection

* **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatically fetches available models (Flash, Pro, Ultra, Experimental).


* **Terminal Friendly**: Preserves terminal history and avoids screen clearing for better compatibility.



## 💻 Usage

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `exit` | Quit the application |
| `model` | Change the selected AI model |
| `stats` | View detailed session statistics |
| `stream` | Toggle streaming mode ON/OFF |
